# AI Customer Support Automation for D2C Brands

## Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered automation system designed to improve customer support operations for Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) brands. It focuses on practical AI usage through prompt engineering and workflow automation rather than complex machine learning models.

## Problem Statement

D2C brands receive a large number of repetitive customer queries related to order tracking, refunds, and product information. Handling these queries manually increases response time and operational overhead.

## Solution

An AI-based automation workflow that classifies customer queries, generates automated responses, detects customer sentiment, and escalates negative or complaint-related queries to human support teams.

## Key Features

- AI-driven customer query classification
- Automated response generation using prompt engineering
- Sentiment detection for prioritizing negative queries
- Smart escalation for complaints
- Ticket tracking using Google Sheets (CRM simulation)

## System Workflow

Customer Query → AI Classification & Response → Sentiment Detection → Auto Resolution / Escalation → Ticket Tracking

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Prompt Engineering (GenAI)
- Google Sheets (Ticket Tracking)

## Testing

The system was tested using real-world sample customer queries to validate classification accuracy, sentiment detection, and escalation logic.

## Business Impact

- Reduces repetitive customer support workload
- Improves response time and customer experience
- Enables efficient handling of high-priority customer issues

## Future Scope

- Integration with WhatsApp, Email, or CRM platforms
- Advanced AI-based sentiment analysis
- Support analytics dashboard

## Conclusion

This project serves as a proof-of-concept showcasing how AI automation can be applied to real business workflows in a D2C environment.
